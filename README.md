The repository accompanies the NUBI II naturalistic driving study and implements a baseline-referenced decomposition framework for understanding cardiac activation during everyday driving using continuous multimodal wearable sensing.

# Overview

Many physiologically meaningful behaviors are not characterized by rare extreme events but by modest physiological responses that occur repeatedly throughout daily life. Quantifying these repeated physiological exposures requires continuous measurements of physiology together with synchronized behavioral and environmental context.

Using one week of naturalistic monitoring from wearable devices, smartphones, and vehicles, this work characterizes the cardiac operating regime associated with everyday driving relative to non-driving sedentary behavior.

The proposed framework decomposes instantaneous heart rate into four interpretable components:

1. participant-specific physiological baseline,
2. context-specific cardiac offset,
3. additional modulation by behavioral, environmental, and individual characteristics,
4. residual variation.

The repository reproduces every analysis reported in the manuscript, including:

- exploratory data characterization,
- baseline-referenced operating-regime analysis,
- predictive decomposition using nested grouped cross-validation,
- elastic-net modulator analysis,
- long-horizon scenario projections and trait-anxiety contrast uncertainty analysis,
- supplementary heart-rate missingness analyses,
- supplementary participant-level physiological traces.

# Analysis pipeline

The principal scripts should be executed sequentially.

| Script | Primary output |
|---------|----------------|
| 00 | Nested grouped cross-validation and predictive decomposition |
| 01–06 | Figures 1–6 and associated manuscript tables |
| 07 | Figure 7, Table 5, long-horizon scenario projections, and uncertainty analysis of the trait-anxiety contrast |
| 08 | Supplementary Table S1 (heart-rate missingness analyses) |
| 09 | Supplementary Figure S1 (participant-level HR traces) |

Each script creates its own output directory and reproduces the corresponding manuscript figures and tables.

# Methodological summary

The analysis uses participant-specific physiological baseline heart rate obtained from the Apple HealthKit `restingHeartRate` metric.

Baseline-referenced heart rate is defined as

```math
NHR = HR_{\mathrm{raw}} - HR_{\mathrm{base}}
```

The predictive framework represents instantaneous heart rate as

```math
HR_{\mathrm{raw}}
=
HR_{\mathrm{base}}
+
\tau_c
+
\phi(X)
+
\epsilon
```

where

- $HR_{\mathrm{base}}$ is the participant-specific baseline.
- $\tau_c$ is the context-specific offset.
- $\phi(X)$ represents modulation by observed covariates.
- $\epsilon$ is residual variation.

Prediction performance is evaluated using nested grouped cross-validation to ensure complete separation of participants between training and testing folds.

# Software requirements

The analyses were developed in R. R version 4.6 or later is recommended.

The analysis scripts use the following R packages:

- `data.table`
- `doParallel`
- `dplyr`
- `forcats`
- `ggpattern`
- `ggplot2`
- `lubridate`
- `patchwork`
- `purrr`
- `readr`
- `rlang`
- `scales`
- `stringr`
- `tibble`
- `tidymodels`
- `tidyr`

Package dependencies are loaded by the individual scripts where required.

# Reproducibility

All scripts

- use deterministic random seeds where applicable,
- create output directories automatically,
- avoid manual intervention during execution,
- generate publication-ready figures directly from the released dataset.

Running the scripts sequentially reproduces the analyses reported in the accompanying manuscript.
